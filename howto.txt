For ease of approval, formatting your data into the correct json makes the process faster.
If you fear technology and cannot fathom how then just dump the data and I will work it out.
If there is anything programmatically lacking that you would like, please suggest it.

Please create a new file in the pending folder to add your event suggestions.
If you do not know how to git, you can use the doc.
