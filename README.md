If you want to contribute, read the howto.txt guide; it explains the basics.
If you still need more help or you have suggestions for improving the timeline, feel free to contact me on Twitter (@minamisawasenri). I will probably not respond during work hours (BST).

Planned changes:
* Move the filter buttons to hide by default, expand by clicking a filter icon in header
* Add a guide for those unfamiliar with github to allow them to up their events
* Cookies for remembering filters upon revisiting the page
* Some way to prevent youtube videos and images from loading unless required
* Replace country emoji with language flag for universal look (GB is currently displaying)
* A better way of handling multiple authors to content, allow multiple to write for each entry

Thanks to https://codyhouse.co for the basic timeline.
