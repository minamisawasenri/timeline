I will probably not respond during work hours.

Planned changes:
Move the filter buttons to hide by default, expand by clicking a filter icon in header
Add a guide for those unfamiliar with github to allow them to up their events
Cookies for remembering filters upon revisiting the page
Some way to prevent youtube videos and images from loading unless required
Replace country emoji with language flag for universal look (GB is currently displaying)
A better way of handling multiple authors to content, allow multiple to write for each entry
